# Recommendation_System

A recommendation system is a type of artificial intelligence or machine learning system designed to suggest items, products, or services to users based on their preferences, behavior, or historical data. It is widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, social media, and other applications to improve user engagement and satisfaction.

### Explicit Feedback vs. Implicit Feedback
In recommender systems, machine learning models are used to predict the rating of a user on an item. At inference time, we recommend to each user the items having highest predicted rating.

We therefore need to collect user feedback, so that we can have a ground truth for training and evaluating our models. An important distinction has to be made here between explicit feedback and implicit feedback.
